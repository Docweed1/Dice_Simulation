# Dice_Simulation

.NET2 week1

This was my first individual assignment for .NET2 C#.

Here were the requirements for the assignment:

Design, implement, test, and debug a C# program to simulate the rolling of two dice 100 times.  Whenever the two dice display the same number, the program should show the roll sequence number (e.g. the 10th roll) and the number on the dice (e.g. both dice throw 6).
